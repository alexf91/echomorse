# echomorse

Learning morse code with speeds of about 25 WPM can be very tedious.
While it's relatively easy to recognize all characters on their own,
decoding conversations at full speed does not come without a lot of training.

With this application, you can play all pressed keys on your keyboard as morse code
and listen to them. This will hopefully get your speed up to the point where
you can actually get on the air.
